    List<String> answer = [
      "Share Yourself Artists is a community of the best internet artists and "
          "publications. Artists save tons of time and are exposed to new resources "
          "of exposure for less. For less than 2 quarters presubmission, artists "
          "can easily submit their artwork to, and possibly be featured on, the "
          "largest blogs in the art community. By purchasing a credit, the artists "
          "is entitled to feedback, critiques, or appraisals from the publication. "
          "Share Yourself Artists also offers hardworking bloggers and publications "
          "to receive an income for sharing incredible artwork.",
      "Yes you may! Our user interface allows artists to upload as many pieces as "
          "their hearts may possibly desire. Credits can be used on any and all "
          "of artists's works.",
      "Yes you may! Our one time purchase deal is 8 credits for \$5.",
      "Blog Signup Options can be found with the Artist Sign-up. You will then "
          "be directed to upload and description page where you can set up your "
          "Publication Account. PLEASE NOTE: There is a 25,000 follower minimum "
          "for blogs/magazines.",
      "Nope. Standard credits are completely free.",
      "Head to www.shareyourselfartists.com/business_signup for more information!",
      "Credits are used to send your song to a blog. There are two types: standard "
          "and premium.When you use a premium credit, your submission filters to "
          "the top of that blog's dashboard. The blog you send to then has to: 1) "
          "respond within 48 hours (96 hours for labels); 2) listen to at least 20 "
          "seconds; 3) approve the song, or provide a minimum of 10 words explaining "
          "why it was not a good fit.If they do not satisfy these requirements, "
          "you get your credit back to be used again.Premium credits tend to have "
          "a higher approval rate because blogs are encouraged to spend time with "
          "the song, rather than making a split-second decision.With standard "
          "credits, there are no such requirements: a blog can choose to provide "
          "feedback if they wish, but may instead make a quick decision and move "
          "onto the next song. You receive two standard credits every four hours, "
          "and should see a countdown on the submit page that indicates when they "
          "will refresh.",
      "Premium credits start at about 65-70 cents per credit. When buying a "
          "monthly credit package, however, credits are as low as 40 cents per credit.",
      "The majority of money from premium purchases goes to the blogs. The rest "
          "goes toward transaction fees, hosting fees, and salaries so that we can "
          "keep making Share Yourself Artists better.",
      "I'm afraid not. SYAâ€™s mission is to connect blogs with people who want their "
          "work promoted. We make the process transparent, and work to improve "
          "the chances that you'll actually hear back after sending your masterpiece "
          "out. That said, we cannot force a blog to share your submission. "
          "That's entirely up to them :)",
      "Select the upload icon from the top of your dashboard... Once there, you'll be able to add "
          "a new art piece, or select one you've already uploaded. After you've "
          "done that, you can then select the type of credit you'd like to use, "
          "and choose the blogs you want to send your art to.",
      "Blogs get paid at least \$0.15 per response given. Larger and more active "
          "publications will be given an increased rate all the way up to \$0.50 "
          "per submission(will likely increase in the future). Blogs are required "
          "to write a 50 character response to each photo. A blog could easily "
          "respond to 100 submissions per hour, earning them a wage of \$15/per hour. "
          "With these calculations the largest blogs can make up to \$50/per hour.",
      "Although all credit purchases are final, each artist will be refunded each "
          "credit for any blog that does not respond or comment on their submission. "
          "Share Yourself Artists wants to help artists get seen by large players "
          "in the art industry, not make artists pay to be ignored."
